    /**
     Use this init method to create a new classifier.

     The classifier will be created from locally cached model data. If no appropriate model data is found in cache,
     a fetch request will be made to the server, and the init will immediately return nil. Assuming an internet
     connection is available, a second attempt to create the classifier, a second later, should return a valid
     classifier.

     - Note: Classifiers should be retained and reused. Classifier creation requires potentially expensive cache
     lookups and remote model data fetches. As such, creating new classifiers should only be done on an as needed
     basis, and existing classifiers should be reused while still valid.

     Classify a `LocomotionSample` to determine its most likely `ActivityTypeName`.
     
     - Note: This method is the main purpose of classifiers, and is optimised with the expectation that it will called
     repeatedly during an app session. Although there is unavoidably some energy cost to classifying samples,
     so the frequency of classifications should be considered carefully, especially in long running apps.
     
     For example, the LocoKit Demo App calls a classifier every time a new location is received, thus up to about
     once every second. On the other hand, [Arc App](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/arc-app-location-activity-tracker/id1063151918?mt=8)
     classifies samples only once every six seconds at most, due to the expectation that the app will be recording
     and classifying potentially hours of data each day.

    /**
     Determine whether the given coordinate is inside the classifier's geographical region.

     This method works well in combination with `isStale` as a test for whether a classifier should be used to classify
     a sample, or whether a fresh classifier should instead be requested.

     - Note: Ideally classifiers should only be used to classify samples that fall inside the classifier's region.
     However if relevant model data is in the local cache and no internet connection is available, thus a fresh
     classifier cannot be fetched, a stale and/or geographically inappropriate classifier may continue to be used,
     albeit with potentially reduced accuracy.

     Extended transport activity types (car, train, etc) will have especially inaccurate results when classified
     by a geographically inappropriate classifier. However base types (walking, running, etc) should receive
     adequately accurate results in any classifier, regardless of geographical appropriateness.
