 The possible Activity Types for a Locomotion Sample. Use an `ActivityTypeClassifier` to determine the type of a
 `LocomotionSample`.

 - Note: The stationary type may indicate that the device is lying on a stationary surface such as a table, or that
   the device is in the user's hand or pocket but the user is otherwise stationary.
